This is matlab2tikz, a MATLAB(R) script for converting MATLAB(R) figures into native
TikZ figures.

To download and rate matlab2tikz, go to its page on MathWorks 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022.

As of now, matlab2tikz does by far not support the conversion of all possible
MATLAB figures. In particular, 3D plots are not yet supported. However, if
you have a nice 2D plot, matlab2tikz might just do what you want it to.

The plots that matlab2tikz handles properly are, but are not limited to

  * most axes properties (including logarithmic scaling),
  * grids,
  * line plots (including markers line styles),
  * error bars,
  * contour(f) plots,
  * bar plots (stacked, grouped, histgrams),
  * stem plots,
  * stairs plots,
  * quiver (arrow) plots,
  * colorbars,
  * legends,
  * images,
  * (rose plots),
  * (compass plots),
  * (polar plots),
  * subplots,
  * zplane plots,
  * frequency response plots,
  * scatter plots,
  * surf plots.


The workflow is as follows.

  0.) a) Place the matlab2tikz script in a directory where MATLAB can find it
         (the current directory, for example).
      b) Make sure that your LaTeX installation includes the packages

            tikz (aka pgf, >=2.00)

	 and

	    pgfplots (>=1.3).

  1.) Generate your plot in MATLAB.

  2.) Invoke matlab2tikz by

        >> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz' );

      Optional:
      The scripts accepts several options, for example 'height', 'width', 'encoding', and some more. Invoke by

        >> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz', 'height', '4cm', 'width', '3in' );

      To specify the dimension of the plot from within the LaTeX document, try
        
	>> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz', 'height', '\figureheight', 'width', '\figurewidth' );

      and in the LaTeX source
 
        \newlength\figureheight
        \newlength\figurewith
        \setlength\figureheight{4cm}
	\setlength\figurewidth{6cm}
	\input{myfile.tikz}

  3.) Add the contents of myfile.tikz into your LaTeX source code; a
      convenient way of doing so is to use \input{/path/to/myfile.tikz}.
      Also make sure that at the header of your document the packages tikz and
      pgfplots are included:

          \usepackage{pgfplots}

      and optionally (as of Pgfplots 1.3)

          \pgfplotsset{compat=newest}
          \pgfplotsset{plot coordinates/math parser=false}

There are reported incompatibilties with the follwing LaTeX packages:
