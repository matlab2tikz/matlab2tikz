This is matlab2tikz, a MATLAB(R) script for converting MATLAB(R) figures into native
TikZ/pgfplots figures.

To download and rate matlab2tikz, go to its page on MathWorks 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22022.

matlab2tikz supports the conversion of most MATLAB figures,
including 2D and 3D plots. For plots constructed with third-
party packages, your mileage may vary.

The workflow is as follows.

  0.) a) Place the matlab2tikz scripts (contents of src/ folder) in a directory where 
         MATLAB can find it (the current directory, for example).
      b) Make sure that your LaTeX installation includes the packages

            tikz (aka pgf, >=2.00)

	 and

	    pgfplots (>=1.3).

  1.) Generate your plot in MATLAB.

  2.) Invoke matlab2tikz by

        >> matlab2tikz();

      or

        >> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz' );

  3.) Add the contents of myfile.tikz into your LaTeX source code; a
      convenient way of doing so is to use \input{/path/to/myfile.tikz}.
      Also make sure that at the header of your document the packages tikz and
      pgfplots are included:

          \usepackage{pgfplots}

      and optionally (as of Pgfplots 1.3)

          \pgfplotsset{compat=newest}
          \pgfplotsset{plot coordinates/math parser=false}

  Note:
    The script accepts several options; check them out by invoking the help,

      >> help matlab2tikz

    for example 'height', 'width', 'encoding', and some more. Invoke by

      >> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz', 'height', '4cm', 'width', '3in' );

    To specify the dimension of the plot from within the LaTeX document, try

      >> matlab2tikz( 'myfile.tikz', 'height', '\figureheight', 'width', '\figurewidth' );

    and in the LaTeX source

      \newlength\figureheight
      \newlength\figurewidth
      \setlength\figureheight{4cm}
      \setlength\figurewidth{6cm}
      \input{myfile.tikz}

There are reported incompatibilties with the follwing LaTeX packages:
