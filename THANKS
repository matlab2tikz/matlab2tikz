matlab2tikz has greatly profited from its ancestor, Matfig2PGF.

  http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/12962

Matfig2PGF is written by Paul Wagenaars.

Also, the author would like to thank Christian Feuersänger package pgfplots
without which the structure of matlab2tikz would need to be a lot more
complicated.
