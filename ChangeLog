	* Version 0.0.6.
	* Support for scatter plots.
	* Preliminary support for surface plots; thanks to Pooya.
	* Large changes in the codebase:
	  - next to matlab2tikz.m, the file pgfplotsEnvironment.m
	    is now needed as well; it provides a much better
	    structured approach to storing and writing environments
	    when parsing the MATLAB(R) figure
	* proper MATLAB(R) version check
	* lots of small fixes
