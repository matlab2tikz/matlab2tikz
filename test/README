This test module is part of matlab2tikz.

It provides the means for easily comparing the results of a direct PDF print of a figure in MATLAB as opposed to having it exported by matlab2tikz. As a matter of fact, this test suite can take any matlab2xxx-converter as argument (see step 2 below) with possibly minor modifications to the LaTeX file output.


=======
 USAGE:
=======
  1.) Open MATLAB, make matlab2tikz and matlab2tikz_acidtest available for calling (by putting in the MATLAB Path,for example).

  2.) Call the script by

         >> matlab2tikz_acidtest( @matlab2tikz );

      What happens it that MATLAB generates a number of figures as defined in testfunctions.m, and exports them as PDF (using the print command) and by matlab2tikz. At the same time, a LaTeX file is created in the tex-subfolder.

  3.) You can compile 'tex/acid.tex' with 'make' (making use of 'tex/Makefile').

If all goes well, the result will be the file 'tex/acid.pdf' which contains a list of the test figures, exported as PDF and right next to it the matlab2tikz generated plot.
